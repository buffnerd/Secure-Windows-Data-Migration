# Start by resetting the password for the each user you are migrating
# You will need admin rights or System32 access to do this yourself

# This is a simple step that will be useful when working with a user so they don't have to think about multiple password changes when migrating to a new domain

# It is a good idea to keep test devices until the end of a migration from an old domain to a new one depending on the SLAs you have in place with parent company
