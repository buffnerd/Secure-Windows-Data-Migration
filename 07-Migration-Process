# After following all the previous steps, it is time to migrate the profile.  But before migrating
# it is important to uninstall SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) and unenroll from Intune or whatever MDM application the parent company uses.

# Run the batch script and executables on steps 07a, 07b, and 07c and then Migrate the profile to the appropriate domain with the associated user.

# IMPORTANT:  Before this step, AD for the new domain should have already been set up with all users who are being migrated from the previous domain.
#             If this has not been done, you will be unable to continue, and you shouldn't have even started in the first place.
